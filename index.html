	  <h1> The Weasley Family </h1>
    <h4> "Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love." -Albus Dumbledore </h4>
	  
	  <h3> Bill Weasley </h3>
	  <p> William Weasley, better known as Bill Weasley, is the oldest of the seven Weasley children. His birthday is 29 November 1970. In the winter of 1995, he began dating a quarter-veela by the name of Fleur Delacour, later marrying her on 1 August 1997. During the Battle Of The Tower in June 1997, he was attacked by Fenrir Greyback and was left with scars on his face. Luckily for Bill, Greyback was in his human form when he attacked, so Bill did not become a werewolf, although he did develop some wolfish tendencies (such as liking very rare steaks). </p>
	  
	  <h3> Charlie Weasley </h3>
          <p> Charlie Weasley was born on the 12th of December, 1972. He lives in Romania, working with dragons. He does not show up in the movies, only briefly appearing in a photo during Prisoner Of Azkaban. He is the second eldest of the Weasley children. </p>
	  
	  <h3> Percy Weasley </h3>
	  <p> Percy Weasley, the family-betraying prat, was born on 22 August 1976. He was a prefect in the first movie, and after he graduated, he began breaking contact with his family while working for Barty Crouch Sr. He didn't show up when his father, Arthur Weasley, was injured in Order Of The Phoenix. He also was cruel and heartless enough to send back his traditional Weasley sweater, unopened, with no note. He finally came to his senses when the Ministry fell to Voldemort in Deathly Hallows, fighting alongside Harry Potter. The only joke he ever cracked was during the Battle, just before his brother was killed. Nice timing, mate. </p>
	  <h3> Fred and George Weasley </h3>
	  <p> Fred Weasley, one half of the Weasley Twins, was born on April 1st, 1978, a few minutes before his twin brother, George Weasley. Fred and George were well known for their many pranks and mischiefs at Hogwarts, and barely spent a moment apart. They later ditched school and followed their dream of opening a joke shop named Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. In 1997, George Weasley lost his left ear during a run-in with Death Eaters. Tragically, on the 2nd of May, 1998, Fred Weasley was killed in a wall explosion during the Battle Of Hogwarts. After this, George Weasley was no longer able to produce a Patronus, as all of his happy memories were with Fred. </p>
	  
	  <h3> Ron Weasley </h3>
	  <p> Ronald Weasley, better known as Ron Weasley, ws born on the 1st of March, 1980. He is the best friend of Harry Potter and husband of Hermione Granger. He welcomed Harry into his family in 1992, breaking him out of his home in the Weasley's flying car (a light blue Ford Anglia). He is a loyal friend and loves his large family very much. He also has a very large love for food. </p>
		  
	  <h3> Ginny Weasley </h3>
	  Ginevra Weasley, also known as Ginny Weasley, is the youngest and only female of the Weasley children, born on 11 August, 1971. She grew up having a fangirl crush on Harry Potter, and eventually married him. She is not afraid to speak her opinion, and very much enjoys casting hexes. She loves her brothers very much, even if she doesn't always show it. </p>
	
	<h3> Arthur Weasley </h3>
	<p> Arthur Weasley was born on the 6th of February, 1950. He works in the Ministry of Magic in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office. He works hard to make sure his children and wife have a good life. In 1995, he was injured by a Basilisk, saved only by Harry's visionary dream. </p>
	
	<h3> Molly Weasley </h3>
	<p> Molly Weasley was born on 30 October, 1949. She is a very loving and hardworking mother, easily welcoming Harry Potter into her family. She's a fantastic cook and knits all seven of her children lovely sweaters every year, including Harry and Hermione. She's a stay-at-home mother. </p>
