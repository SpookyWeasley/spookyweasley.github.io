	  <h3> Bill Weasley </h3>
	  <p> William Weasley, better known as Bill Weasley, is the oldest of the seven Weasley children. His birthday is 29 November 1970. In the winter of 1995, he began dating a quarter-veela by the name of Fleur Delacour, later marrying her on 1 August 1997. During the Battle Of The Tower in June 1997, he was attacked by Fenrir Greyback and was left with scars on his face. Luckily for Bill, Greyback was in his human form when he attacked, so Bill did not become a werewolf, although he did develop some wolfish tendencies (such as liking very rare steaks). <p>
